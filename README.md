# Hungarian Phrasebook

This is a binary-to-text encoding tool similar to PGP word list, RFC 1751, and mnemonicode.

In fact, it incorporates https://github.com/bwhmather/python-mnemonicode as a commandline option.

Aside from mnemonicode you can use the home-brew version. This is the default. It has a slightly higher compression rate, but arguably worse choice of words.
